# Deriv Trading Repo Guardian

A governing repo skill that forces future agent work on this project to follow a strict architecture, deletion policy, consolidation policy, and UI/backend parity workflow.

---

## Target Architecture

```
core/           — market models, indicators/features/regimes, strategies, signal pipeline,
                  entry logic, exit logic, TP/SL/trailing, risk logic,
                  portfolio/trade state logic, settings schemas

runtimes/       — research runner, backtest runner, paper runner, demo runner, live runner

infrastructure/ — db/storage, data adapters, broker adapters, logging, stream/scheduler plumbing

ui/             — research, live, settings

app/            — routing, app wiring, dependency composition
```

## V3 Live Architecture (current — as of Task #106)

**The live path runs exclusively on V3 native-engine scoring. There is no V2 shared scoring path in the live system.**
`strategies.ts` / `signalRouter.ts` / `scoring.ts` are BACKTEST-ONLY — not called in live scan.

### 8 Symbol-Native Engines
| Symbol  | Engine(s) |
|---------|-----------|
| BOOM300 | `boom_expansion_engine` |
| CRASH300| `crash_expansion_engine` |
| R_75    | `r75_continuation_engine`, `r75_reversal_engine`, `r75_breakout_engine` |
| R_100   | `r100_continuation_engine`, `r100_reversal_engine`, `r100_breakout_engine` |

### V3 Core Files (all in `src/core/`)
| File | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| `engineTypes.ts` | `EngineResult`, `EngineContext`, `CoordinatorOutput` types |
| `engines/boom300Engine.ts` | boom_expansion_engine |
| `engines/crash300Engine.ts` | crash_expansion_engine |
| `engines/r75Engines.ts` | r75_continuation, r75_reversal, r75_breakout |
| `engines/r100Engines.ts` | r100_continuation, r100_reversal, r100_breakout |
| `engineRegistry.ts` | Symbol → engine(s) mapping; loud failure on misconfiguration |
| `symbolCoordinator.ts` | Per-symbol conflict resolution; sets `resolvedDirection` + `coordinatorConfidence` |
| `engineRouterV3.ts` | Live scan entry: `scanSymbolV3()` → `V3ScanResult` (includes features) |
| `portfolioAllocatorV3.ts` | Engine-aware risk allocation; `allocateV3Signal()` |
| `hybridTradeManager.ts` | Stage 1→2 SL promotion at 20% TP; `promoteBreakevenSls()` |

### V3 Scheduler Live Path
```
scheduleStaggeredScan → scanSingleSymbolV3(symbol, stateMap)
  → scanSymbolV3(symbol)           # engineRouterV3
  → allocateV3Signal(coordinator)  # portfolioAllocatorV3
  → [verifySignal()]               # openai.ts (optional AI verify)
  → openPositionV3(...)            # tradeEngine.ts
```

### V3 Position Management
```
positionManagementCycle:
  1. promoteBreakevenSls()   # hybridTradeManager — stage 1→2 SL promotion
  2. manageOpenPositions()   # tradeEngine — stage 3 trailing + closes
```

### DB Notes
- No schema changes for V3. `strategyName` field stores engine name. `notes` field has `"V3 HybridStaged | ..."` prefix.
- `signalLogTable.strategyFamily` = `"v3_engine"` for V3 signals.

### Score Thresholds (current state as of Task #106)
- **Current operating gates:** Paper ≥ 60, Demo ≥ 65, Real ≥ 70
- Enforced in `index.ts` startup SQL via unconditional upsert. Do NOT lower these startup upserts.
- Gates will be raised as engine calibration data supports higher thresholds — raise them in platform_state directly.
- Max observed engine scores (calibration): BOOM300/sell≈58, CRASH300/buy≈56, R_75≈83, R_100≈81.
- Do NOT add aspirational threshold targets in code, docs, or AI prompts. Only current operating gates belong in active V3 guidance.

### Signal Visibility (Engine Decisions page)
- `signal_visibility_threshold` = 50 (platform_state, seeded at startup via upsert using `LEAST(current, 50)`).
- `GET /api/signals` shows rows where: `allowedFlag=true` OR `compositeScore ≥ 50` OR `executionStatus IN ('blocked','rejected')` OR `rejectionReason IS NOT NULL`.
- Rejected lifecycle signals write `executionStatus='blocked'` with lifecycle state in `aiReasoning` field.

### Frontend — Research Page (Task #92 + #106)
- Research page has **two tabs**: AI Analysis tab and Backtest tab.
- Backtest tab: `POST /api/backtest/v3/run` → renders summary metrics + per-symbol trades table + JSON export buttons (Summary and Trades).
- Export functions use V3Trade fields: `entryTs`, `exitTs`, `nativeScore`, `pnlPct`, `holdBars`, etc.

---

## Architecture Rules

- Code is organized by responsibility, not by UI tab or screen
- Research, backtest, paper, demo, and live all share the same core trading logic (strategy logic, signal scanning, entry logic, exit logic, TP/SL/trailing, risk logic, symbol-specific thresholds)
- Backtests must replay the same trading logic used in live trading — no separate trading-decision implementation for backtests
- Runtimes are thin wrappers only — differences allowed only for: data source, scheduling, execution adapter, simulation details
- Risk logic belongs in core; risk configuration belongs in settings UI
- **Backtest simulation files (strategies.ts, signalRouter.ts, scoring.ts)**: BACKTEST-ONLY — do not add them to live path
- **V3 engines (live)**: all live signal decisions flow through `engineRouterV3.ts` → `symbolCoordinator.ts` → `portfolioAllocatorV3.ts`

---

## Strict Working Policy

- One concern = one owner file/module
- No duplicate strategy logic, risk logic, TP/SL logic, scanner logic, or threshold definitions
- No duplicate constants across files
- No `v2`, `new`, `backup`, `temp`, `old`, `final`, or alternate implementation files
- No silent fallback paths in trading logic
- No preserving replaced implementations — when behavior changes, the old path is removed
- Any new logic must declare: source-of-truth file, direct callers, deleted/replaced files
- UI items must map to real endpoints or real local functions — if a UI item has no working backend path, remove it; if backend exists and is intended to be user-facing, wire the UI

### Non-Negotiable Clause

> Never preserve old behavior through fallback logic. When behavior is intentionally changed, remove the previous path completely and update all callers to the new path.

---

## Deletion Policy

- Delete replaced code — do not comment it out
- Do not preserve legacy code without explicit written justification
- Remove backup/temp/alternate implementation files
- Remove fallback branches and alternate paths

---

## Mandatory 6-Phase Workflow

**Phase 1 — Audit**: Enumerate all files; identify what each does, whether it is imported/used, what imports it; identify duplicates, mixed-responsibility files, dead/legacy/fallback code; identify UI routes/components; identify backend endpoints/functions; produce UI-to-endpoint mapping.

**Phase 2 — Delete**: Delete unused, obsolete, duplicate, superseded, backup-like, temp-like, and legacy files; remove commented-out dead code; remove fallback branches and alternate paths.

**Phase 3 — Consolidate**: Move trading decision logic into shared core; ensure all runtimes call the same core engine; remove separate research/live decision paths.

**Phase 4 — Runtime cleanup**: Make runtimes thin wrappers only; allow differences only for data source, scheduling, execution adapter, or simulation details.

**Phase 5 — UI/backend parity**: Inspect every UI item; verify each visible user action is wired to a real backend endpoint or function; if backend exists but UI is not wired, add the wiring; if UI exists without real support, remove it; backend-only completion is not acceptable.

**Phase 6 — Validation**: Report deleted files, consolidated files, moved files, canonical source-of-truth files, UI items removed, UI items newly wired, endpoint changes, any remaining technical debt explicitly.

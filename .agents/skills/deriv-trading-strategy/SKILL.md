# Deriv Trading — Long Hold Strategy

> **This file is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH.** All trading code, strategy thresholds, scoring parameters, TP/SL calculations, and AI behavior must conform to this document. If code contradicts this skill, the code is wrong.

## Section 1 — Core Philosophy & Mandates

### Trading Philosophy
- **Large capital, long hold, max profit** — swing trades on highest-probability signals only
- **TP targets full spike magnitude (50-200%+)** — TP is the PRIMARY exit
- **NEVER scalp** — no 1-5% micro-trades, no high-frequency entries
- **NEVER reduce TP targets** — the system targets the full move, not partial captures

### Exit Hierarchy (NO time-based exits)
1. **TP hit** — primary exit, targeting full 50-200%+ moves
2. **SL hit** — 1:5 R:R derived from TP
3. **30% trailing stop** — safety net, activates only after reaching 30% of TP target distance

There is **NO 72-hour time exit**. Research shows trades hold 9-44 days. The trailing stop handles profit protection. Trades stay open until TP, SL, or trailing stop closes them.

### Capital Turnover
- Trade full capital at least 1-2x per month
- System should always be scanning for the next high-conviction setup once a trade closes
- ~8-9 swing trades per month across 4 symbols keeps capital active

### Active Trading Symbols
Only 4 symbols are traded: **CRASH300, BOOM300, R_75, R_100**

All other symbols are for data collection and research only.

### Scoring Thresholds (DO NOT CHANGE)
| Mode | Min Composite Score |
|------|-------------------|
| Paper | **85** |
| Demo | **90** |
| Real | **92** |

### Critical Mandates — NEVER VIOLATE
1. TP targets 50-200%+ full spike magnitude — NEVER reduce
2. Trailing stop is SAFETY NET ONLY — activates after 30% of TP target reached
3. Never use ATR-based TP/SL exits — all exits from market structure and spike magnitude
4. Use 1500+ candle structural windows for swing levels, VWAP, pivots, Fibonacci
5. Strategy directionality: **CRASH → BUY** after swing low. **BOOM → SELL** after swing high.
6. No time-based forced exits — the trailing stop handles profit protection
7. Each strategy must be calibrated PER SYMBOL — no universal static thresholds

## Section 2 — Empirical Research Findings

### Walk-Forward Analysis: 6 Months of Data, All 4 Active Symbols

#### CRASH300 — 185% Total Range, 11 Major Swings
| Direction | Magnitude | Duration | Entry Pattern |
|-----------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| UP | +176% | 44 days | Crash spike cluster (7+ in 24h), 14% decline, reversal |
| UP | +79% | 17 days | Crash spike cluster (5+ in 24h), 8% decline, reversal |
| UP | +45% | 9 days | Crash spike cluster (3-5 in 24h), 5% decline |
| DOWN | -62% | 24 days | 7d rally +21%, 23 spikes in 7d, exhaustion cascade |
| DOWN | -45% | 14 days | 7d rally +15%, 18 spikes in 7d, failed recovery |
| DOWN | -33% | 13 days | 7d rally +8%, 14 spikes in 7d, momentum fade |

**Entry patterns discovered:**
- **Every swing LOW**: Cluster of crash spikes (3-7 in 24h, 7-10+ in 4h), 24h decline of 5-14%, then reversal UP for 25-176%
- **Every swing HIGH**: 7d rally of 8-21%, 14-23 crash spikes in 7d but price kept recovering, then exhaustion cascade DOWN 21-62%
- **Trade frequency**: ~2 swings/month, hold 4-44 days

#### BOOM300 — 245% Total Range, 9 Major Swings (23-47% each)
- **Mirror image of CRASH300 but inverted**
- Boom spikes UP between downward drifts
- Entry: SELL after swing high / boom spike cluster exhaustion
- Entry: BUY after sustained drift-down exhaustion (swing low)
- **Trade frequency**: ~1.5 swings/month, hold 2-24 days

#### R_75 — 220% Total Range, 19 Major Swings (12-52%)
- **Most active instrument** — swings every 5-18 days
- Average swing ~22% over 8 days
- No spike-specific behavior — continuous random walk with mean reversion
- Entry based on: price at 30-day range extreme + directional reversal confirmation
- **Trade frequency**: ~3 swings/month, hold 3-18 days

#### R_100 — 164% Total Range, 11 Major Swings (18-92%)
| Direction | Magnitude | Duration |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| UP | +92% | 27 days |
| UP | +67% | 11 days |
| DOWN | -39% | 13 days |
| DOWN | -37% | 15 days |

- Bigger moves but less frequent than R_75
- **Trade frequency**: ~2 swings/month, hold 3-27 days

#### Aggregate Statistics
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total trades/month (all symbols) | ~8-9 |
| Active positions at any time | 2-4 |
| Average hold time | 3-44 days |
| Move capture target | 20-176% per swing |
| Win target | 75%+ of detected swings |

### What The Current System Gets Wrong
1. `spike_event` uses hazard score threshold (>0.70) — triggered only 6 times in 6 months vs 1,096 real spikes
2. `mean_reversion` waits for RSI<32 + zScore<-1.8 — lagging indicators that fire on noise
3. `breakout_expansion` looks for BB squeeze — ZERO compression-breakout patterns exist on synthetics
4. Static thresholds applied universally — BOOM300 behavior ≠ R_100 behavior
5. EMA slope thresholds (0.0002) not normalized to instrument price/ATR
6. 72h time exit killed trades that needed 9-44 days to reach TP

---

## Section 3 — Instrument Family Behavior

### Boom Indices (BOOM300)
- **Spike direction**: Price spikes UPWARD periodically
- **Drift direction**: Price drifts DOWN between upward spikes
- **Primary trade**: SELL after swing high / spike cluster exhaustion
- **How it works**: Boom 300 has a 1-in-300 chance per tick of an upward spike. Between spikes, price slowly drifts downward. The strategy sells after price has been pushed up by multiple boom spikes and shows signs of exhaustion.

### Crash Indices (CRASH300)
- **Spike direction**: Price drops DOWNWARD periodically via spikes
- **Drift direction**: Price drifts UP between downward spikes
- **Primary trade**: BUY after swing low / spike cluster exhaustion
- **How it works**: Crash 300 has a 1-in-300 chance per tick of a downward spike. Between spikes, price slowly drifts upward. The strategy buys after price has been pushed down by multiple crash spikes and shows signs of exhaustion/recovery.

### Volatility Indices (R_75, R_100)
- **Behavior**: Continuous random walk, mean-reverting over multi-day periods
- **No spike-specific behavior** — pure price action and technicals
- **Primary trade**: BUY or SELL based on trend/reversal signals at range extremes
- **How it works**: Price oscillates within ranges. When it reaches the extreme of its 30-day range and shows reversal signals, enter counter-trend.

### Spike Counting Method
- **CRASH**: `rawMove < -0.01` (1%+ single-candle price drops are spikes)
- **BOOM**: `rawMove > 0.01` (1%+ single-candle price rises are spikes)
- Count rolling windows: 4h, 24h, 7d

---

## Section 4 — The Five Strategy Families

### 4.1 Trend Continuation
**What it captures**: After a confirmed swing reversal, ride the new trend direction.

**CRASH (BUY)** — ride the upward drift after swing low:
- Confirmed swing low: `distFromRange30dLowPct < 0.03` AND `priceChange24hPct > 0.005`
- Drift up confirmed: `emaSlope > 0.0002`
- Not exhausted: RSI 35-70
- Trend confirmed: 24h change > 1%
- Not overextended: > 2% below 30-day high

**BOOM (SELL)** — ride the downward drift after swing high:
- Confirmed swing high: `distFromRange30dHighPct > -0.03` AND `priceChange24hPct < -0.005`
- Drift down confirmed: `emaSlope < -0.0002`
- Not exhausted: RSI 30-65
- Trend confirmed: 24h change < -1%
- Not overextended: > 2% above 30-day low

**VOLATILITY (BUY/SELL)**:
- Confirmed reversal with EMA slope alignment (>0.0003 or <-0.0003)
- Pullback to EMA (|emaDist| < 0.01), RSI 35-65

### 4.2 Mean Reversion
**What it captures**: Price at multi-day/multi-week extremes showing exhaustion.

**CRASH (BUY)**: Near 30d low (< 3%), 7d decline > 5%, RSI < 35
**BOOM (SELL)**: Near 30d high (> -3%), 7d rally > 5%, RSI > 65
**VOLATILITY**: z-score extremes (±1.5) with multi-day moves

Also triggers on **liquidity sweep**: swing breached AND reclaimed within 3 candles, small candle body < 0.35.

### 4.3 Spike Cluster Recovery
**What it captures**: The reversal after a cluster of spikes exhausts the move. This is the highest-conviction setup for Boom/Crash.

**Boom/Crash only** (returns null for Volatility indices).

Entry conditions:
- 3+ spikes in 4h OR 5+ spikes in 24h
- 5%+ 24h exhaustion move (CRASH: decline, BOOM: rally)
- Reversal candle (CRASH: green candle, BOOM: red candle), small body < 0.40
- EMA slope flattening toward zero

**From the research**: This is exactly the pattern at EVERY major swing low/high in CRASH300 and BOOM300.

### 4.4 Swing Exhaustion
**What it captures**: The end of a sustained multi-day move where momentum is fading.

**CRASH (SELL — counter-trend exit signal)**:
- 14+ spikes in 7d
- Price up 8%+ in 7d
- Near 30d high
- Failed new high in 24h (momentum loss): `priceChange24hPct < 0.005`
- Slope turning down: `emaSlope < 0.0001`

**BOOM (BUY — counter-trend entry after exhaustion)**:
- 14+ spikes in 7d
- Price down 8%+ in 7d
- Near 30d low
- Failed new low in 24h: `priceChange24hPct > -0.005`
- Slope turning up: `emaSlope > -0.0001`

**VOLATILITY**: 10%+ 7d move near range extremes, RSI extreme (>72/<28), failed continuation in 24h

### 4.5 Trendline Breakout
**What it captures**: Break of a multi-touch support/resistance trendline with momentum confirmation.

Entry conditions:
- 2+ trendline touches (resistance or support)
- Price breaks through with momentum: `atrAccel > 0.01`, `candleBody > 0.30`
- Break distance within 2.5× ATR
- EMA slope aligned with breakout direction

---

## Section 5 — TP/SL & Trade Management

### Take-Profit — Boom/Crash Indices (Spike-Magnitude-Aware)
1. Primary TP = 50% of `longTermRangePct` from rolling 60-90 day spike analysis
2. Minimum TP floor = 10% of entry price
3. Targets full spike travel (50-200%+ moves). Never scalp.

### Take-Profit — Volatility Indices (Structural S/R)
1. TP = entry ± 70% of major swing range (from 1500+ candle structural levels)
2. Minimum range floor = 2% of entry price

### Stop-Loss — All Instruments
1. SL distance = TP distance / 5 (**1:5 R:R ratio**)
2. Safety cap: max loss = 10% of equity per position
3. No independent SL calculation — derived from TP

### 30% Peak-Profit Trailing Stop (PRIMARY PROFIT PROTECTION)
- **Activation**: Only after trade reaches 30% of TP target distance
- **Before activation**: Only fixed SL protects downside
- **After activation**: Tracks peak unrealized profit
- **Trigger**: Profit drops 30% from peak (e.g., peak 10% → exit at 7%)
- Constant: `PROFIT_TRAILING_DRAWDOWN_PCT = 0.30`

### Exit Priority (NO time exits)
1. **TP hit** (primary) — targeting full 50-200%+ moves
2. **SL hit** — 1:5 R:R derived from TP
3. **30% trailing stop** — activates after 30% of TP target reached

### Position Sizing
- Size = equity × `equity_pct_per_trade` × clamp(confidence, 0.5, 1.0)
- Minimum: 5% of equity
- Maximum: remaining capacity within 80% equity deployment cap
- Max open trades: 3-6 (configurable per mode)
- Max per symbol: 2 (different strategy families)

### Constants
| Constant | Value | Location |
|----------|-------|---------|
| R:R Ratio | 5 | `tradeEngine.ts` |
| Boom/Crash TP target | 50% of 90-day range | `calculateSRFibTP` |
| Boom/Crash TP floor | 10% of entry | `calculateSRFibTP` |
| Vol TP | 70% of major swing range | `calculateSRFibTP` |
| Vol TP floor | 2% of entry | `calculateSRFibTP` |
| Equity safety cap | 10% per position | `calculateSRFibSL` |
| Trailing drawdown | 30% | `PROFIT_TRAILING_DRAWDOWN_PCT` |
| Trailing activation | 30% of TP target | `calculateProfitTrailingStop` |

## Section 6 — Scoring System (Big Move Readiness)

### Overview
Replaced logistic regression with empirical Big Move Readiness Score based on research of actual 50-200%+ moves. No ML model — pure rule-based scoring from observed preconditions.

### Readiness Score (5 Dimensions, 0-100)

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures | Key Thresholds |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| Range Position | **25%** | Proximity to 30-day range extreme | ≤18% from extreme = 100, ≤30% = 70, >50% = 0 |
| MA Deviation | **20%** | Distance from 7/14-day moving average | ≥8% deviation = 100, ≥5% = 70, <2% = 0 |
| Volatility Profile | **20%** | Elevated ATR rank + BB width expansion | ATR rank ≥1.3 + BB expanding = 100 |
| Range Expansion | **15%** | BB width rate-of-change, ATR acceleration | Both accelerating = 100 |
| Directional Confirmation | **20%** | Reversal candle pattern + MA slope change | Both present = 100 |

### State Keys for Weights
- `scoring_weight_range_position` (default: 25)
- `scoring_weight_ma_deviation` (default: 20)
- `scoring_weight_volatility_profile` (default: 20)
- `scoring_weight_range_expansion` (default: 15)
- `scoring_weight_directional_confirmation` (default: 20)

### Composite Score Thresholds
| Mode | Min Composite Score |
|------|-------------------|
| Paper | **85** |
| Demo | **90** |
| Real | **92** |

Additional filters: EV ≥ 0.001, R:R ≥ 1.5

## Section 7 — Forex Royals Reference (Proven Working Bots)

The user's brother runs profitable bots on Deriv synthetics. These are the reference benchmarks:

| Bot | Symbol | Entry | TP | SL | R:R | Gain | Hold |
|-----|--------|-------|----|----|-----|------|------|
| BOOM HUNTER X | Boom 300 | 1812 | 2412 (600pt) | 1462 (350pt) | 1.7:1 | 10.76% | Days |
| SKY BREAK | Boom 300 | Same setup | Same | Same | Same | 3 lots | Days |
| FXR-S3 | Crash 500 | 3186 | 2836 (350pt) | 3436 (250pt) | 1.4:1 | 4.18% | Days |

**Key insights from Forex Royals:**
- On $1,364 balance generating $808 floating profit (59% return)
- Wide SL/TP (hundreds of points), not tight scalping levels
- Multiple simultaneous positions on same symbol (different lot sizes)
- Simple RSI + EMA + price action timing
- R:R ratios of 1.4:1 to 2:1 are normal and profitable for these instruments

## Section 8 — Multi-Timeframe Analysis

### Available Timeframes
| Category | Timeframes | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Micro | 1m, 5m | Tick-level entry timing, spike detection |
| Short | 15m, 1h, 2h | Intraday patterns, short-term structure |
| Medium | 4h, 8h, 12h | Multi-session structure, regime detection |
| Long | 1d, 2d, 4d | Swing structure, multi-day trends |
| Macro | 7d, 15d, 30d | Trend direction, range boundaries |

### Multi-Timeframe Confluence
Higher timeframes reveal patterns invisible on 1m/5m data:
- **4h/8h**: Confirms whether a spike cluster is truly exhausting or just a blip
- **1d/2d**: Shows the multi-day swing structure that defines TP targets
- **7d/15d**: Shows the macro trend and range boundaries for the 30-day range position score
- **30d**: Monthly range for long-term trend assessment

Strategies should reference multi-timeframe confluence for highest-conviction entries. A signal that aligns across 1h, 4h, and 1d timeframes is far higher conviction than one visible only on 1m.

### Data Infrastructure
- Live tick aggregation populates all timeframes automatically from incoming ticks
- Historical enrichment aggregates existing 1m candle data into all higher timeframes
- Candles table stores: symbol, timeframe, openTs, closeTs, open, high, low, close, tickCount

## Section 9 — AI Monthly Recalibration Process

### Overview
The AI within the app uses EXISTING collected data (ticks are already streaming, candles already aggregated — no new download needed) to continuously improve strategy calibration.

### Monthly Recalibration Steps
1. **Identify big moves**: Query existing candle data for all moves of 25%+ within any 7-day window in the latest month
2. **Measure entry conditions**: For each big move, record the exact feature values at the entry point (EMA slope, RSI, range position, spike count, distance from MA, etc.)
3. **Test current settings**: Run the current strategy thresholds against each move — does the system detect it?
4. **Iterative refinement**: If a move is NOT detected:
   - Adjust the relevant strategy threshold
   - Test again
   - Repeat until it detects the move
5. **Per-symbol, per-strategy**: Do this for EACH big move on EACH symbol for EACH strategy family
6. **Average thresholds**: Once all moves are detected individually, average the successful detection thresholds across all moves per strategy per symbol
7. **Walk-forward validation**: Run a full backtest with the averaged settings — verify it still catches all known events without excessive false positives
8. **Trend analysis**: Compare results to previous month:
   - Are profits increasing or decreasing?
   - Are any strategies catching fewer moves? (degradation detection)
   - Has a strategy that was profitable become unprofitable? (broker may have changed algorithm)
9. **Generate suggestions**: Output specific settings suggestions with values and rationale
10. **Flag degradation**: If a strategy family is losing effectiveness across 2+ consecutive months, flag it for review

### Key Principle
The system is **self-sufficient** after initial historical data download. Live tick streaming populates all candle timeframes continuously. The AI recalibration reads from this existing data — it never needs to download new data.

## Section 10 — Per-Symbol Strategy Calibration Research

### Calibration Methodology
For each symbol × strategy combination:
1. Identify every historical event the strategy SHOULD have caught
2. Record the exact feature values at the entry point across multiple timeframes
3. Find the threshold ranges that capture all events without false positives
4. Document the calibrated per-symbol thresholds below
5. Validate with walk-forward: do the calibrated thresholds catch all known moves?

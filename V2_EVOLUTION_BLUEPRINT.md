## Section 2: UI Enrichment Roadmap

### 2a. Research — Backtest Detail Popup with Charts & Metrics

**Goal:** When a user clicks a backtest result row in the Research page's grouped results section, a full-screen modal opens showing rich metrics, charts, and the trade list for that backtest run.

#### Metrics Grid

Display the following metrics in a 4×2 grid of stat cards at the top of the modal:

| Metric | Source field in `StrategyMetrics` | Format |
|---|---|---|
| Net Profit | `netProfit` | Currency ($X,XXX.XX) |
| Win Rate | `winRate` | Percentage (XX.X%) |
| Profit Factor | `profitFactor` | Decimal (X.XX) |
| Sharpe Ratio | `sharpeRatio` | Decimal (X.XX) |
| Max Drawdown | `maxDrawdown` | Percentage (−XX.X%) |
| Trade Count | `tradeCount` | Integer |
| Avg Holding Hours | `avgHoldingHours` | Hours/days string (e.g. "3d 12h") |
| Expectancy | `expectancy` | Currency ($X.XX per trade) |

Colour coding: green for positive values (profit, high win rate), red for negative (losses, drawdown), amber for neutral.

#### Equity Curve Chart

- Use recharts `LineChart` (already in the project).
- X-axis: timestamps from `equityCurve[].ts`.
- Y-axis: equity values from `equityCurve[].equity`.
- Green line, 2px stroke, no dots.
- A dashed horizontal reference line at the initial capital value.
- Tooltip showing date and equity on hover.
- Responsive container, 300px height.

#### Candlestick Chart with Trade Markers

- Render a candlestick/OHLC chart for the symbol over the backtest period.
- Green candles (close > open), red candles (close < open).
- Overlay trade entry markers: **green upward triangles** for buy entries, **red downward triangles** for sell entries.
- Overlay trade exit markers: **green dots** for profitable exits, **red dots** for losing exits.
- Data source: candles from the `candles` table for the backtest's symbol and date range.
- Recharts `ComposedChart` with custom `Bar` shapes for candlestick rendering, or consider a lightweight library like `lightweight-charts` if recharts proves limiting.
- Include a zoom/pan scroll bar for navigating the date range.

#### Trade List Table

Every trade from `BacktestTrade[]` displayed in a sortable table:

| Column | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Entry Time | `entryTs` | Date + time |
| Exit Time | `exitTs` | Date + time |
| Direction | `direction` | Badge: green "BUY" / red "SELL" |
| Entry Price | `entryPrice` | 4 decimal places |
| Exit Price | `exitPrice` | 4 decimal places |
| P&L | `pnl` | Green/red coloured currency |
| Exit Reason | `exitReason` | Badge: TP, SL, TIME_EXIT, etc. |
| Hold Duration | `holdingHours` | Formatted as "Xd Yh" |
| Position Size | `positionSize` | Currency |
| Confidence | `confidence` | Percentage |

Default sort: by entry time descending. Allow sorting by any column.

#### AI Chat Button

- A floating "Ask AI" button within the modal (bottom-right corner).
- Clicking it opens the existing `AIChatPanel` component, passing the `backtestId`.
- Allows the user to ask questions about the specific backtest without leaving the modal.

#### API Requirements

- Existing endpoint: `GET /api/backtest/results` returns `metricsJson` which contains `StrategyMetrics` including `equityCurve`.
- New endpoint needed: `GET /api/backtest/:id/trades` — returns all `BacktestTrade[]` for a given backtest run ID.
- New endpoint needed: `GET /api/backtest/:id/candles` — returns OHLC candle data for the symbol and date range of the backtest.

---

### 2b. Trades — Enriched Open & Closed Trade Details

**Goal:** Add more context columns to the Open Positions and Trade History tables so users can understand why each trade was taken and how it performed.

#### Open Positions — Additional Columns

| New Column | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Signal Family | `strategyName` mapped to family label | Badge with family colour |
| Composite Score | From signal log at entry time | Numeric badge (colour-coded) |
| Amount | `size` field | Already shown, rename header for clarity |
| Duration | Computed: `now - entryTs` | Live updating "Xd Yh Zm" |
| Entry Reason | `notes` field (contains strategy reason) | Truncated with tooltip on hover |

#### Trade History — Additional Columns

| New Column | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Signal Family | `strategyName` mapped to family label | Badge with family colour |
| Composite Score | From signal log at entry time | Numeric badge |
| Hold Duration | Computed: `exitTs - entryTs` | Formatted as "Xd Yh" |
| Exit Reason | `exitReason` field | Badge: TP (green), SL (red), trailing (amber), time (grey), manual (blue) |
| Amount | `size` field | Currency format |

#### Backend Fields to Expose

The `trades` table already has `strategyName`, `exitReason`, `size`, `entryTs`, `exitTs`, and `notes`. The following may need to be added or exposed:

- `compositeScore` — store the signal's composite score at entry time on the trade record. Currently not persisted on the trade row; would need to be captured during `openPosition()`.
- `strategyFamily` — can be derived from `strategyName` but storing it explicitly would be cleaner.
- `entryReason` — the `notes` field currently contains this, but a dedicated column would allow filtering.

#### Export

Existing CSV/JSON export functionality remains unchanged. The new columns should be included in exports automatically.

---

### 2c. Signals — "See Details" Popup

**Goal:** When a user clicks a signal row in the Decision Review page, a detail popup/drawer opens showing the full signal data.

#### Full Signal Header

- Symbol, direction (BUY/SELL badge), strategy family (coloured badge), timestamp.
- Composite score (large, coloured badge).
- Execution status: Approved (green) or Blocked (red) with rejection reason.

#### 6 Scoring Dimensions with Visual Bars

Display all 6 dimensions from `ScoringDimensions` with horizontal progress bars and numeric values:

| Dimension | Description | Bar Colour Logic |
|---|---|---|
| Regime Fit | How well the current regime matches the strategy | ≥80 green, ≥60 amber, <60 red |
| Setup Quality | Model score margin + EV strength + regime compatibility | Same |
| Trend Alignment | EMA slope alignment with trade direction | Same |
| Volatility Condition | ATR/BB width relative to ideal range for the family | Same |
| Reward/Risk | TP/SL ratio scoring | Same |
| Probability of Success | Model score as percentage | Same |

Each bar should be ~200px wide, filled proportionally (0-100 scale). Numeric value displayed to the right.

#### Feature Vector Snapshot

Show the raw technical indicators at the time the signal was generated:

| Feature | Field | Format |
|---|---|---|
| RSI (14) | `rsi14` | XX.X |
| EMA Slope | `emaSlope` | ±X.XXXXX |
| ATR (14) | `atr14` | X.XXXX (as % of price) |
| BB Width | `bbWidth` | X.XXXX |
| Z-Score | `zScore` | ±X.XX |

**Backend requirement:** The feature vector is not currently persisted with the signal log. To support this, either:
- Store a `featureSnapshot` JSON column on `signal_log` during `logSignalDecisions()`.
- Or re-compute features on demand (slower, less accurate for historical signals).

Recommendation: store a compressed feature snapshot at log time.

#### Regime Classification

- Regime state label (e.g. "trend_up", "compression", "spike_zone").
- Confidence level as a percentage with a visual indicator (circular gauge or bar).
- Already available: `regime` and `regimeConfidence` fields on the signal log.

#### AI Verdict

- Full verdict: Agree / Disagree / Uncertain (coloured badge).
- Full reasoning text (multi-line, scrollable).
- Confidence adjustment value.
- Already available: `aiVerdict`, `aiReasoning`, `aiConfidenceAdj` fields.

#### Entry/Exit Parameters

| Parameter | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Suggested SL | `suggestedSl` | As percentage distance from entry |
| Suggested TP | `suggestedTp` | As percentage distance from entry |
| Position Size | `allocationPct * capital` | Currency amount |
| Expected Hold Time | From `FAMILY_HOLD_PROFILE[family].initialExitHours` | "Xd" format |

#### API Requirements

- Existing endpoint `GET /api/signals` returns signal data with scoring dimensions, AI verdict, regime info.
- May need a new detail endpoint `GET /api/signals/:id` returning the full signal record including feature snapshot (once stored).

### 2d. Data — Price Charts with Timeframe Selector

**Goal:** Add interactive price charts to the Data page so users can visually inspect price action across different timeframes.

#### Chart Types

Toggle between two chart modes:
1. **Line Chart** — Simple close-price line. Recharts `LineChart`, green stroke.
2. **Candlestick Chart** — OHLC bars. Green for bullish (close > open), red for bearish (close < open).

Default: Line chart. Toggle button in the chart header.

#### Timeframe Selector

Horizontal button group with the following options:

| Label | Duration | Candle Resolution | Approx Candle Count |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1H | Last 1 hour | 1m candles | 60 |
| 6H | Last 6 hours | 1m candles | 360 |
| 12H | Last 12 hours | 1m candles | 720 |
| 24H | Last 24 hours | 5m candles | 288 |
| 1M | Last 1 month | 5m candles | ~8,640 |
| 3M | Last 3 months | 1h candles | ~2,160 |
| 12M | Last 12 months | 1h candles | ~8,760 |

For short timeframes (1H–12H), use raw 1m candles from the `candles` table.
For 24H and 1M, use 5m candles.
For 3M and 12M, use 1h candles (already stored with `timeframe = '1h'`).

#### OHLC Candlestick Colouring

- Bullish candle (close > open): green body, green border.
- Bearish candle (close < open): red body, red border.
- Doji (close ≈ open): grey body.
- Wicks extend to high/low.

#### 5m Candles Tab

Add a "5m Candles" tab alongside the existing "M1 Candles" tab in the Data page's data table section. This tab shows the 5-minute aggregated candle data in the same tabular format as the M1 tab.

#### Backend Endpoint Requirements

- New endpoint: `GET /api/data/chart` with query parameters:
  - `symbol` (required): instrument symbol
  - `timeframe` (required): `1m`, `5m`, or `1h`
  - `from` (optional): start timestamp (epoch seconds)
  - `to` (optional): end timestamp (epoch seconds)
  - `limit` (optional): max candles to return (default 1000)
- Returns: `{ candles: { openTs, closeTs, open, high, low, close, tickCount }[] }`
- For 5m candles: if not pre-aggregated, aggregate on-the-fly from 1m candles (group by `Math.floor(openTs / 300) * 300`).

## Section 3: Strategy Threshold Inventory

A complete catalog of every hardcoded threshold ("magic number") across all 4 strategy families and supporting systems.

### 3.1 Strategy Entry Thresholds

#### Trend Continuation (`strategies.ts` → `trendContinuation()`)

| Threshold | Current Value | Variable/Expression | Purpose | Impact of Change |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| EMA slope (uptrend) | > 0.0003 | `features.emaSlope > 0.0003` | Minimum slope to consider price in an uptrend | Lower → more signals in weak trends; higher → fewer but stronger trend signals |
| EMA slope (downtrend) | < −0.0003 | `features.emaSlope < -0.0003` | Minimum slope for downtrend | Same as above, for sell direction |
| EMA distance (pullback) | < 0.008 | `Math.abs(features.emaDist) < 0.008` | Price must be close to EMA (pullback) | Higher → allows entries farther from EMA; lower → tighter pullback requirement |
| RSI lower bound | > 38 | `features.rsi14 > 38` | RSI must not be oversold | Lower → allows entries in weaker momentum; higher → stricter momentum filter |
| RSI upper bound | < 65 | `features.rsi14 < 65` | RSI must not be overbought | Lower → more restrictive; higher → allows entries in stronger momentum |
| Z-score extreme | < 2.0 | `Math.abs(features.zScore) < 2.0` | Price must not be statistically extreme | Lower → filters out more volatile moments; higher → allows more deviation |

#### Mean Reversion (`strategies.ts` → `meanReversion()`)

| Threshold | Current Value | Variable/Expression | Purpose | Impact of Change |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RSI oversold | < 32 | `features.rsi14 < 32` | RSI level for oversold condition | Lower → fewer but more extreme signals; higher → more frequent signals |
| RSI overbought | > 68 | `features.rsi14 > 68` | RSI level for overbought condition | Higher → fewer signals; lower → more signals |
| Z-score oversold | < −1.8 | `features.zScore < -1.8` | Statistical deviation for oversold | Lower (more negative) → stricter; higher → more signals |
| Z-score overbought | > 1.8 | `features.zScore > 1.8` | Statistical deviation for overbought | Higher → stricter; lower → more signals |
| Consecutive candles | ≥ 3 | `Math.abs(features.consecutive) >= 3` | Minimum adverse candle run | Higher → requires more exhaustion; lower → triggers earlier |
| Candle body (sweep) | < 0.35 | `features.candleBody < 0.35` | Small body indicates rejection wick | Higher → allows bigger bodies; lower → stricter rejection wick filter |
| Swing breach candles | 0–3 | `swingBreachCandles >= 0 && <= 3` | Breach must be recent (last 0-3 candles) | Wider range → allows older breaches |

#### Breakout Expansion (`strategies.ts` → `breakoutExpansion()`)

| Threshold | Current Value | Variable/Expression | Purpose | Impact of Change |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BB width (squeeze) | < 0.006 | `features.bbWidth < 0.006` | Bollinger Band squeeze detection | Higher → more instruments qualify as squeezed; lower → stricter squeeze |
| ATR rank (expanding) | > 0.8 | `features.atrRank > 0.8` | Volatility expansion confirmation | Lower → allows lower volatility expansion; higher → stricter |
| BB %B upper band | > 0.85 | `features.bbPctB > 0.85` | Price at upper Bollinger Band | Lower → triggers on weaker breakouts; higher → requires stronger push |
| BB %B lower band | < 0.15 | `features.bbPctB < 0.15` | Price at lower Bollinger Band | Higher → triggers on weaker breakdowns; lower → requires stronger push |
| BB width (compressed) | < 0.008 | `features.bbWidth < 0.008` | Compression for expansion sub-strategy | Higher → more lenient; lower → stricter |
| BB width RoC | > 0.10 | `features.bbWidthRoc > 0.10` | Rate of BB expansion | Lower → triggers on slower expansion; higher → requires faster expansion |
| ATR acceleration | > 0.08 | `features.atrAccel > 0.08` | Volatility momentum | Lower → triggers earlier; higher → requires stronger acceleration |
| Candle body (expansion) | > 0.6 | `features.candleBody > 0.6` | Strong directional candle body | Lower → allows weaker candles; higher → requires more conviction |

#### Spike Event (`strategies.ts` → `spikeEvent()`)

| Threshold | Current Value | Variable/Expression | Purpose | Impact of Change |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Spike hazard score | > 0.70 | `features.spikeHazardScore > 0.70` | Probability threshold for spike imminence | Lower → more frequent spike signals; higher → fewer but higher probability |
| Boosted score blend | 0.4 × score + 0.5 × hazard | `score * 0.4 + spikeHazardScore * 0.5` | Weight balance between model and hazard | Adjusting weights shifts reliance between ML model and statistical hazard |
| Minimum expected value | 0.008 (floor) | `Math.max(expectedValue, 0.008)` | Minimum EV override for spike signals | Lower → allows lower quality setups; higher → stricter quality gate |

### 3.2 Per-Family Config (`strategies.ts` → `FAMILY_CONFIG`)

| Family | minModelScore | minEV | minRR | slMultiple | tpMultiple |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| trend_continuation | 0.58 | 0.005 | 1.5 | 2.5 | 6.0 |
| mean_reversion | 0.60 | 0.006 | 1.8 | 3.0 | 4.0 |

| spike_event | 0.62 | 0.008 | 2.0 | 1.5 | 4.0 |

- **minModelScore**: Minimum ML model score to proceed with signal generation. Lower → more signals but potentially lower quality.
- **minEV**: Minimum expected value. Filters out low-edge setups.
- **minRR**: Minimum reward-to-risk ratio (unused directly in entry filter, used in signal router).
- **slMultiple**: ATR multiplier for stop-loss distance. Higher → wider stops, fewer SL hits, but larger losses when hit.
- **tpMultiple**: ATR multiplier for take-profit distance. Higher → larger targets, fewer TP hits, but larger wins when hit.

### 3.3 Regime Engine Thresholds (`regimeEngine.ts`)

| Threshold | Current Value | Purpose | Impact of Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Strong trend (EMA slope) | > 0.0005 | Minimum slope for trend classification | Lower → more trend regimes; higher → fewer, stronger trends only |
| Very strong trend | > 0.001 | Override threshold for strong trend | Same direction, higher bar |
| BB width squeeze | < 0.005 | Compression regime detection | Higher → more squeezes detected |
| BB width RoC (expanding) | > 0.15 | Breakout expansion regime detection | Lower → more expansion regimes |
| ATR acceleration (expanding) | > 0.10 | Confirms volatility expansion | Lower → earlier expansion detection |
| High volatility ATR | > 0.004 | High vol environment marker | Lower → more instruments flagged |
| Z-score overstretched | > 2.0 | Mean reversion regime trigger | Lower → more MR regime classifications |
| RSI extreme (oversold) | < 28 | RSI threshold for MR regime | Higher → more MR regimes |
| RSI extreme (overbought) | > 72 | RSI threshold for MR regime | Lower → more MR regimes |
| Spike hazard imminent | > 0.72 | Spike zone regime trigger | Lower → more spike zone classifications |
| Compression flat slope | < 0.0003 | Required for compression regime (no trend) | Higher → allows slight trending to be compression |

## Section 4: Dynamic Threshold Calibration

### Overview

The current system uses static thresholds (Section 3). Market conditions evolve, and thresholds that were optimal 6 months ago may underperform today. A dynamic calibration system would monitor threshold effectiveness over time and suggest adjustments.

### Detection Mechanism

For each threshold in the inventory:

1. **Partition historical trades** by the threshold value that was active when each signal was generated.
2. **Compute rolling win rate** using a sliding window (e.g., last 100 trades or last 30 days, whichever is smaller).
3. **Compare historical vs recent performance:**
   - Historical baseline: win rate over the full backtest period.
   - Recent performance: win rate over the last 30 days.
   - If recent win rate drops more than 15 percentage points below baseline, flag the threshold for review.

### Suggestion Mechanism

When a threshold is flagged:

- Run a parameter sweep over a bounded range (e.g., RSI oversold: test values 25, 28, 30, 32, 35).
- For each candidate value, compute a mini-backtest over the last 30 days of data.
- Select the value that maximizes the Sharpe ratio (or profitability, configurable).
- Generate a human-readable suggestion, e.g.:

> "RSI < 32 produced 65% win rate 6 months ago but only 40% now. Testing alternatives: RSI < 28 yields 55% win rate over last 30 days. Recommend adjusting to RSI < 28."

### Safety Guardrails

| Guardrail | Description |
|---|---|
| Min/max bounds | Each threshold has a hard floor and ceiling (e.g., RSI: 20–45 for oversold). No suggestion can exceed these bounds. |
| Maximum adjustment step | No single adjustment can change a threshold by more than 20% from its current value. |
| User approval required | All suggestions are presented as recommendations. No automatic changes without explicit user confirmation. |
| Rollback capability | The previous threshold value is stored. A one-click rollback button reverts the change. |
| Cooldown period | After a threshold is adjusted, it cannot be re-adjusted for at least 7 days to allow the new value to accumulate data. |
| Minimum sample size | Suggestions require at least 30 trades with the current threshold value before a change is proposed. |

### Data Storage

- New table: `threshold_history` — records every threshold value change with timestamp, old value, new value, reason, and approval status.
- New table: `threshold_performance` — stores rolling win rate snapshots per threshold per time period.

### UI Integration

- A "Threshold Health" section on the Settings or Research page.
- Table showing each threshold, its current value, historical win rate, recent win rate, and a status indicator (green/amber/red).
- "Review Suggestion" button opens a detail panel with the mini-backtest results and a confirmation dialog.

## Section 5: Strategy Degradation Detection

### Overview

Strategies can degrade over time as market microstructure changes. This system monitors the health of each strategy family on a per-symbol basis and alerts when effectiveness drops.

### Win Rate Trend Monitoring

For each (strategy_family, symbol) pair:

1. **Compute rolling 30-day win rate** from closed trades.
2. **Compute rolling 30-day profit factor** from closed trades.
3. **Store snapshots** at the end of each day (or week) in a `strategy_health` table.
4. **Track trend direction**: compare the current 30-day win rate to the 90-day average. If the current window is more than 10 percentage points below the 90-day average, flag as degrading.

### Automatic Alerts

| Alert Level | Condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Green (Healthy) | Win rate within 10% of 90-day average AND profit factor > 1.0 | No action |
| Amber (Caution) | Win rate 10–20% below 90-day average OR profit factor between 0.7 and 1.0 | Warning banner on Research page |
| Red (Degraded) | Win rate > 20% below 90-day average OR profit factor < 0.7 for > 14 days | Alert notification + suggestion to disable strategy for that symbol |

Alerts should be delivered via:
- In-app notification banner (persistent until dismissed).
- Entry in a "System Health" section on the dashboard.
- Optional: webhook/email notification (configurable).

### Dashboard Health Indicators

On the Research page and/or Dashboard:

- Per-strategy health card showing:
  - Strategy family name and icon.
  - Current 30-day win rate (number + trend arrow ↑ ↓ →).
  - Sparkline of win rate over last 6 months.
  - Status badge: Green / Amber / Red.
  - Number of symbols where this strategy is healthy vs degraded.

- Per-symbol breakdown (expandable):
  - Win rate by strategy on each symbol.
  - Heat map: rows = symbols, columns = strategy families, cells = win rate (coloured green/amber/red).

### Monthly Comparison Reports

At the end of each month, automatically generate a summary:

- Total trades per strategy per symbol.
- Win rate vs previous month (delta with arrow).
- Profit factor vs previous month.
- Best/worst performing (strategy, symbol) combinations.
- Recommendations: "Consider disabling spike_event on BOOM300 (win rate dropped from 62% to 35% over 2 months)."

Store as a `monthly_report` record in the database, viewable from the Research page.

### Data Requirements

- New table: `strategy_health_snapshots` with columns: `date`, `strategy_family`, `symbol`, `win_rate_30d`, `profit_factor_30d`, `trade_count_30d`, `avg_pnl_30d`.
- New table: `monthly_reports` with columns: `month`, `report_json`, `created_at`.
- Scheduled job: run daily after midnight UTC to compute and store snapshots.

## Section 6: Emerging Pattern Detection

### Overview

The current system uses 4 fixed strategy families. AI analysis of historical trade data could reveal new tradable patterns not covered by these families — for example, time-of-day effects, cross-instrument correlations, or candle pattern sequences.

### How AI Analyzes Trades for New Patterns

1. **Data preparation**: Export all backtest and live trades with their feature vectors at entry time, plus the outcome (win/loss, P&L, hold duration).

2. **Feature importance analysis**: Use the AI model to identify which features are most predictive of winning trades that were NOT generated by existing strategies. Focus on:
   - Time features (hourOfDay, dayOfWeek) — are there profitable time windows?
   - Cross-correlation — do trades on correlated instruments have predictive value?
   - Candle structure patterns — specific sequences of candleBody, upperWickRatio, lowerWickRatio.
   - Multi-timeframe divergence — 1m regime vs 5m regime vs 1h regime disagreements.

3. **Clustering**: Group winning trades by feature similarity (unsupervised clustering). Identify clusters that don't map to any existing strategy family. These are "emerging pattern candidates."

4. **Pattern validation**: For each candidate cluster:
   - Run a targeted backtest using only the cluster's entry criteria.
   - Require minimum 30 trades, > 50% win rate, profit factor > 1.2.
   - Cross-validate with walk-forward testing.

### Patterns Not Covered by Current Families

Potential patterns the system cannot currently detect:

| Pattern Type | Description | Why Not Currently Covered |
|---|---|---|
| Session open effects | Increased volatility at synthetic index generation boundaries | No session/time-based entry logic |
| Cross-pair divergence | BOOM and CRASH of same index diverging unusually | Cross-correlation feature exists but isn't used for entries |
| Volatility index regime shift | R_75/R_100 transitioning between low and high vol regimes | Covered partially by regime engine but no dedicated strategy |
| Wick rejection patterns | Specific candle sequences (hammer, engulfing) | candleBody feature exists but no pattern sequence detection |
| Clustering exhaustion | Multiple strategies firing on the same symbol simultaneously | Correlation check exists but no "signal clustering" entry |

### Suggesting New Strategy Rules

The AI system would output suggestions in a structured format:

```
{
  "patternName": "session_boundary_breakout",
  "description": "Breakout signals that occur within 30 minutes of hourOfDay=0 have 15% higher win rate",
  "entryConditions": {
    "hourOfDay": [23, 0, 1],
    "bbWidth": "< 0.007",
    "emaSlope": "> 0.0002"
  },
  "backtestResults": {
    "winRate": 0.63,
    "profitFactor": 1.8,
    "tradeCount": 47,
    "sharpeRatio": 1.2
  },
  "confidence": "medium",
  "recommendation": "Add as time filter to breakout_expansion strategy"
}
```

### Human Review and Approval Workflow

1. AI generates pattern suggestion → stored in `pattern_suggestions` table with status "pending".
2. Notification appears in the Research page: "1 new pattern suggestion."
3. User clicks to review: sees the pattern description, entry conditions, backtest results, and confidence level.
4. User can:
   - **Approve** → Pattern rules are added to a "custom patterns" configuration (not hardcoded).
   - **Reject** → Pattern is archived with reason.
   - **Request more data** → System runs additional backtests with different parameters.
5. Approved patterns enter a "paper only" trial period (configurable, default 30 days).
6. After the trial, the system reports actual performance vs predicted performance.
7. User can then promote to demo/real or retire the pattern.

## Section 7: Competitive Adaptation

### Overview

If other algorithmic traders identify the same signals (same indicators, same thresholds), "signal crowding" occurs — multiple bots enter at the same time and price, reducing the edge. The system needs mechanisms to maintain an advantage.

### Varying Entry Timing

- **Staggered entry**: Instead of entering immediately when a signal fires, add a randomized delay of 1–5 candles (configurable).
- **Confirmation candle**: Wait for the next candle to close in the expected direction before entering. This reduces crowded entries at the exact signal candle.
- **Entry price improvement**: Use limit orders slightly better than the current price (e.g., 0.1% below for buys) instead of market orders.
- **Time-weighted entry**: Spread the position across 2–3 entries over a short window (already partially implemented via the probe/confirmation/momentum staging system).

### Position Sizing Variation

- **Randomized sizing**: Add ±5–15% random variation to position sizes. This makes the system's footprint less predictable.
- **Inverse crowding sizing**: If signal crowding indicators suggest high crowding, reduce position size by 30–50%. If no crowding detected, use full size.

### Exit Strategy Variation

- **Randomized TP levels**: Instead of fixed ATR multiples, vary the TP target by ±10% per trade.
- **Time-based partial exits**: Close 30% of position at 50% of TP, 30% at 75% of TP, and let the remaining 40% run to full TP or trailing stop. Different bots likely use different exit structures.
- **Adaptive trailing stop**: Vary the trailing stop percentage based on the current volatility regime rather than using a fixed percentage.

### Randomized Delays to Avoid Crowded Entries

Implementation concept:
- When a signal is generated, compute a "crowding risk score" based on:
  - How "textbook" the setup is (high score = common pattern that other bots likely detect).
  - Time of day (certain hours may have more bot activity).
  - Recent signal density on this symbol (many signals in a short window = potential crowding).
- If crowding risk is HIGH (> 0.7): add 2–5 minute delay + randomize ±30 seconds.
- If crowding risk is MEDIUM (0.4–0.7): add 30–120 second delay.
- If crowding risk is LOW (< 0.4): enter immediately.

### Monitoring for Signal Crowding Indicators

Metrics to track that may indicate crowding:

| Indicator | How to Detect | What It Means |
|---|---|---|
| Slippage increase | Compare expected entry price vs actual (for demo/real modes) | Other bots moving price before our entry |
| Win rate compression | Gradual win rate decline on a previously profitable strategy | Edge is being arbitraged away |
| Entry price clusters | Multiple entries at very similar prices within a short window | Multiple bots entering the same signal |
| Decreased hold time to TP | TP hit faster than historical average | Market structure changing due to competition |
| Increased SL hit rate | SL hit rate rising without volatility increase | Other bots creating false breakouts |

Dashboard display:
- "Crowding Risk" indicator per strategy family (low/medium/high).
- Trend chart of slippage and win rate over time.
- Alert when crowding metrics exceed configurable thresholds.

## Section 9: Support/Resistance-Based TP Placement — IMPLEMENTED IN V2

> **Status: IMPLEMENTED.** This section's core concept (S/R-based TP/SL) has been implemented in V2 using
> Fibonacci confluence + swing highs/lows + Bollinger Bands. See `V2_SPECIFICATION.md` Section 2 for the
> actual implementation. The detailed design below was the original planning spec; the V2 implementation
> simplified several aspects (no blend option, no partial TP, no separate sr_levels table — levels are
> computed in real-time from the feature vector).

### Current State

The system calculates take-profit levels purely from ATR multipliers. Each strategy family defines a `tpMultiple` in `FAMILY_CONFIG` (`strategies.ts`), and the `sltp()` function computes TP as `entry ± ATR × tpMultiple`. The trade engine further refines this via `calculateDynamicTP()` in `tradeEngine.ts`, which factors in confidence level, historical average move, and mode-specific capture ratios — but the core mechanism remains ATR-based distance from entry.

The system already computes swing high/low levels via 5-bar pivot detection in `features.ts` (`findSwingLevels`). These swing levels produce `swingHighDist` and `swingLowDist` features that are used as signal inputs (e.g., mean reversion detects swing breach/reclaim patterns). However, these levels are never used for TP targeting. The current exit infrastructure has no concept of support/resistance zones, no horizontal level detection, and no trend line identification.

The `FAMILY_HOLD_PROFILE` in `tradeEngine.ts` also defines per-family `tpAtrMultiplier` values (trend_continuation: 6.0, mean_reversion: 4.0, breakout_expansion: 8.0, spike_event: 4.0), which are mode-overridable via the state table but still fundamentally ATR-based.

### Concept

Replace or augment the fixed ATR-based TP with dynamic, level-based TP targeting. The system would detect horizontal and diagonal support/resistance zones from historical price pivots, then set TP near the next significant S/R level in the trade direction rather than at a fixed ATR multiple.

For a trend line breakout strategy, the flow is:
1. Identify active trend lines (diagonal support/resistance) from recent swing points.
2. Detect when price touches or breaks a trend line (entry trigger).
3. Find the next major S/R level in the trade direction.
4. Place TP near that level (with a small buffer to account for the tendency of price to reverse just before reaching exact levels).

This approach adapts TP to the market structure visible on the chart, potentially improving the reward-to-risk ratio by targeting levels where price has historically reversed rather than arbitrary ATR distances.

### S/R Detection Methods

#### 9.1 Horizontal S/R from Pivot Clusters

Use the existing `findSwingLevels` 5-bar pivot detection as a foundation, but extend it to collect all historical pivots rather than just the most recent swing high/low.

**Algorithm:**
1. Scan the lookback window (e.g., last 200–500 candles) and identify all swing highs and swing lows using the existing pivot logic.
2. Group pivots within a price tolerance band (e.g., ±0.15% of the pivot price). Pivots that fall within the same band form a "level cluster."
3. A cluster with 2 or more touches qualifies as an S/R level. The level price is the average of all pivots in the cluster.
4. Assign a strength score to each level:
   - **Touch count weight**: `touches × 2` (more touches = stronger level).
   - **Recency weight**: each touch is weighted by `1 / (1 + candles_since_touch / 100)`, so recent touches count more.
   - **Breach penalty**: if price has previously broken through the level and closed beyond it, reduce strength by 30% per breach.
   - **Final strength** = `sum(touch_weights × recency_weights) × breach_adjustment`.
5. Rank levels by strength and retain the top N (e.g., 10) levels above and below the current price.

**Tolerance band tuning**: The ±0.15% default should be configurable per instrument family. Volatility 75 Index may need a wider band (±0.25%) while less volatile instruments may need a tighter band (±0.10%).

#### 9.2 Trend Line Detection

Connect successive swing highs (resistance trend line) or swing lows (support trend line) to detect diagonal S/R.

**Algorithm:**
1. Collect all swing highs from the lookback window (200–500 candles).
2. For each pair of swing highs, compute the slope and intercept of the line connecting them.
3. Check how many additional swing highs fall within the tolerance band of this line (projected at their respective bar indices). A valid trend line requires 3 or more touches within tolerance.
4. For multiple overlapping trend lines, keep the one with the most touches and the highest R² (goodness of fit via linear regression).
5. Repeat for swing lows to detect support trend lines.
6. Track the slope of each trend line. Positive slope on a support line = ascending support. Negative slope on a resistance line = descending resistance.
7. Project each trend line forward to the current candle to compute the "current level" value.

**Validity rules:**
- A trend line is invalidated if price closes beyond it by more than 2× the tolerance band (a decisive break).
- Trend lines older than 500 candles without a recent touch (last 50 candles) are discarded.
- Maximum 3 active resistance trend lines and 3 active support trend lines at any time.

#### 9.3 Volume-Weighted Levels

For instruments that provide tick volume data, weight S/R strength by volume at those price zones.

**Algorithm:**
1. Divide the price range of the lookback window into bins (e.g., 0.1% wide).
2. Accumulate tick count (from the `tickCount` field on candle records) for each bin.
3. Identify bins with tick count significantly above the mean (e.g., > 1.5 standard deviations). These are high-volume nodes.
4. High-volume nodes that coincide with horizontal S/R levels (from 9.1) amplify the level's strength score by a configurable factor (e.g., 1.3×).

**Limitation for Deriv synthetic indices:** These instruments are algorithmically generated and do not have traditional order book volume. The `tickCount` field on candle records represents the number of price ticks within the candle's time window, which serves as a proxy for "activity" but does not reflect genuine supply/demand dynamics. Volume weighting should therefore be treated as a secondary confirmation factor, not a primary one, when applied to synthetic indices.

#### 9.4 Multi-Timeframe Confluence

S/R levels that appear on multiple timeframes carry more weight.

**Algorithm:**
1. Run the horizontal S/R detection (9.1) independently on 1m, 5m, and 1h candle data.
2. For each level detected on the 1m timeframe, check if a corresponding level (within tolerance) exists on the 5m and/or 1h timeframe.
3. Apply a confluence multiplier to the strength score:
   - Level on 1m only: 1.0× (baseline).
   - Level on 1m + 5m: 1.5×.
   - Level on 1m + 1h: 2.0×.
   - Level on all three timeframes: 2.5×.
4. Levels detected on 1h candles that do not appear on lower timeframes are still included with a strength floor of 1.5× (higher timeframe levels are significant even without lower timeframe confirmation).

### TP Placement Logic

#### For a BUY Trade

1. Collect all resistance levels (horizontal + diagonal) above the entry price.
2. Filter to levels within a reasonable range: distance must be between 1.5× ATR and 12× ATR from entry. Levels closer than 1.5× ATR are too tight (high chance of noise triggering TP). Levels farther than 12× ATR are unrealistically far.
3. Sort remaining levels by strength (descending).
4. Select the strongest level as the S/R-based TP candidate.
5. Apply a buffer: set TP at `level_price × (1 - 0.002)` (2 pips below the resistance level, since price often reverses just before reaching exact levels).

#### For a SELL Trade

1. Collect all support levels (horizontal + diagonal) below the entry price.
2. Apply the same 1.5–12× ATR range filter.
3. Sort by strength, select the strongest.
4. Apply buffer: set TP at `level_price × (1 + 0.002)` (2 pips above the support level).

#### Fallback to ATR-Based TP

If no qualifying S/R level is found within the valid range, or if the detected levels have very low strength scores (below a configurable minimum, e.g., strength < 3.0), fall back to the existing ATR-based TP calculation. This ensures the system always has a TP level and never leaves a trade without a target.

#### Blend Option

Instead of a binary S/R-or-ATR decision, compute a weighted average:

```
blended_tp = (sr_weight × sr_tp) + (atr_weight × atr_tp)
```

Default weights: `sr_weight = 0.60`, `atr_weight = 0.40`. The weights can be tuned per strategy family:
- **Trend continuation**: 0.50 S/R + 0.50 ATR (trends may push through S/R levels).
- **Mean reversion**: 0.70 S/R + 0.30 ATR (mean reversion profits depend heavily on reaching a level).
- **Breakout expansion**: 0.40 S/R + 0.60 ATR (breakouts often exceed known levels).
- **Spike event**: 0.50 S/R + 0.50 ATR (spikes are unpredictable; balance both).

#### Partial TP at S/R Levels

For higher-confidence setups (composite score ≥ 90), use a staged exit:
1. Close 50% of the position at the nearest S/R level.
2. Move the stop-loss to break-even on the remaining 50%.
3. Let the remaining position run with a trailing stop until either a second S/R level is hit or the trailing stop triggers.

This approach captures guaranteed profit at the first S/R level while allowing the trade to benefit from extended moves. It integrates with the existing trailing stop logic in `tradeEngine.ts`.

### Deriv Synthetic Index Considerations

Deriv synthetic indices (Volatility 10/25/50/75/100, Boom 300/500/1000, Crash 300/500/1000, Range Break 100/200, Step Index, Jump indices) are algorithmically generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator. They do not have:
- Traditional order flow or institutional positioning.
- Genuine volume reflecting supply and demand.
- Fundamental news events that create structural support/resistance.

However, statistical S/R still has predictive value for these instruments because:

1. **Price clusters at round numbers and historical extremes.** The generation algorithm produces price paths that revisit previous high/low levels with non-random frequency due to mean-reverting components in some synthetic index formulas (particularly Volatility indices).

2. **Algorithmic memory effects.** While each tick is generated independently, the cumulative path creates structures (trends, ranges, spikes) that exhibit statistical tendencies around prior turning points. Backtesting can measure whether price reversal probability increases near historical swing levels.

3. **Self-fulfilling dynamics among algorithmic traders.** If multiple bots trade these instruments using S/R-based logic, their collective behaviour can reinforce these levels — entries and exits cluster at the same prices, creating real (if artificial) supply/demand zones.

4. **Empirical validation is essential.** Before deploying S/R-based TP on any synthetic index, run a dedicated backtest comparing:
   - ATR-only TP (current system) vs S/R-based TP vs blended TP.
   - Measure win rate, average profit per trade, profit factor, and Sharpe ratio.
   - If S/R-based TP does not outperform ATR-only on a given instrument, disable it for that instrument and fall back to ATR-only.

5. **Per-instrument calibration.** The tolerance band, minimum strength threshold, and blend weights should be calibrated independently for each synthetic index family. Volatility indices may behave differently from Boom/Crash indices, which have asymmetric spike characteristics.

### Data Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|---|---|
| Extended candle history | S/R detection needs 200–500 candles of lookback. The current system stores 12 months of 1m and 1h candles, which is sufficient. No schema change needed. |
| S/R level cache table | New table `sr_levels` to store detected S/R levels and avoid recomputation on every signal. Columns: `id`, `symbol`, `timeframe`, `level_type` (support/resistance/trendline), `price`, `strength`, `touch_count`, `first_seen_ts`, `last_touch_ts`, `slope` (null for horizontal), `valid` (boolean), `updated_at`. |
| Level strength scoring | Computed during S/R detection and stored in the `sr_levels` table. Refreshed periodically (e.g., every 15 minutes or after each new candle close). |
| S/R computation job | A scheduled job (or on-demand computation triggered by signal generation) that runs S/R detection for each active symbol and updates the `sr_levels` cache. |
| TP decision log | Extend the existing signal log or trade record to include: `tp_method` (atr/sr/blend), `sr_level_used` (price of the S/R level), `sr_level_strength`, `atr_tp_value`, `final_tp_value`. This enables post-hoc analysis of S/R-based TP effectiveness. |

### Integration Points

| Component | File | Integration |
|---|---|---|
| `sltp()` function | `strategies.ts` (line 64–82) | Add an optional `srLevel` parameter. When provided, use it as the TP target (with buffer) instead of or blended with the ATR-based TP. The function signature becomes `sltp(price, direction, atr, slMultiple, tpMultiple, srLevel?)`. |
| `FAMILY_HOLD_PROFILE` | `tradeEngine.ts` (line 381–446) | Add `srBlendWeight` to each family's profile (e.g., trend_continuation: 0.50, mean_reversion: 0.70). The `calculateDynamicTP()` function reads this weight and blends S/R and ATR targets. |
| `findSwingLevels` | `features.ts` (line 110–143) | Extract and generalize the pivot detection logic into a reusable `findAllPivots()` function that returns all historical pivots (not just the most recent swing high/low). This becomes the foundation for horizontal S/R detection (9.1). |
| Signal generation | `strategies.ts` | Before calling `sltp()`, query the `sr_levels` cache for the instrument and pass the nearest qualifying level. Each strategy function gains access to S/R context. |
| Trade opening | `tradeEngine.ts` → `openPosition()` | Log the TP method and S/R level used on the trade record for performance tracking. |
| Partial TP | `tradeEngine.ts` → trade management loop | Add logic to close a portion of the position when price reaches the first S/R level, then adjust SL to break-even on the remainder. Integrates with the existing trailing stop mechanism. |
| Per-strategy overrides | `FAMILY_CONFIG` in `strategies.ts` | Add optional `srEnabled` and `srBlendWeight` fields per family, allowing S/R-based TP to be enabled/disabled and tuned independently for each strategy. |
| Backtest engine | `backtestEngine.ts` | Extend the backtest simulation to support S/R-based TP so that backtests can compare ATR-only vs S/R vs blended TP performance. |

### Estimated Effort and Phase

This feature is placed in **Phase 4** (after Phase 3: Dynamic Calibration + Emerging Patterns + Competitive Adaptation) because it requires:
- Mature health monitoring infrastructure (Phase 2) to validate S/R effectiveness per instrument.
- Sufficient historical trade data to compare ATR-only vs S/R-based TP outcomes.
- The backtest engine enhancements from Phase 3 to properly test S/R TP in backtests.

| Task | Estimated Effort | Dependencies |
|---|---|---|

# Deriv Capital Extraction App

## Overview

The Deriv Capital Extraction App is a quantitative trading research and execution platform designed for Deriv synthetic indices, specifically focusing on Boom and Crash markets. Its primary purpose is to automate and optimize trading strategies through a comprehensive system that includes data collection, backtesting, probability modeling, strategy execution, and sophisticated risk and capital management. The platform aims to identify profitable trading opportunities, manage risk effectively, and automate capital extraction.

## User Preferences

I want iterative development. Ask before making major changes. I prefer detailed explanations.

## System Architecture

The platform is built as a pnpm workspace monorepo using TypeScript, featuring a React frontend and an Express backend.

**Core Layers:**
1.  **Data Collector:** Handles tick ingestion, candle building, and spike event detection.
2.  **Backtesting Engine (V2):** A production-grade simulator mirroring live V2 logic — S/R + Fibonacci TP/SL, 30% profit-based trailing stop, 72h/168h time exits, confidence-scaled position sizing, and portfolio-level equity management. Supports walk-forward testing and provides comprehensive metrics.
3.  **Probability Model:** Focuses on feature engineering and gradient boost scoring.
4.  **Strategy Engine:** Incorporates four strategy families: trend_continuation (trend pullback), mean_reversion (exhaustion rebound, liquidity sweep), breakout_expansion (volatility breakout, volatility expansion), spike_event (spike hazard).
5.  **Risk & Capital Manager:** Manages portfolio allocation, daily/weekly/max-drawdown limits, correlated family caps, and includes a kill switch mechanism.
6.  **Symbol Validator:** Validates configured symbols against Deriv active_symbols API at startup, refuses invalid subscriptions, and runs a stale-stream watchdog with auto-resubscription.

**UI/UX and Technical Implementations:**
-   **Frontend:** Developed with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, and Recharts, providing a modern and responsive user interface.
-   **Backend:** Utilizes Express 5 for API services.
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for efficient data management.
-   **Validation:** Employs Zod (`zod/v4`) and `drizzle-zod`.
-   **API Codegen:** Uses Orval for generating API code from an OpenAPI specification.
-   **Build System:** esbuild is used for CJS bundle creation.
-   **Trading Modes:** Supports three independent trading modes (Paper, Demo, Real) which can run simultaneously, each with independent capital allocation, risk limits, position sizing, and Deriv API tokens.
-   **Signal & ML Pipeline (Regime-First Architecture):** A sophisticated pipeline that includes:
    -   **Feature Engineering:** Computes various technical indicators and regime labels.
    -   **Regime Engine:** Classifies market regimes and defines strategy permissions.
    -   **Probability Model:** Uses per-family models and scoring.
    -   **Strategy Engine:** Implements the four strategy families, gated by market regimes.
    -   **Composite Scoring:** A six-dimension scoring system (Regime Fit, Setup Quality, Trend Alignment, Volatility Condition, Reward/Risk, Probability of Success).
    -   **Signal Router:** Manages conflict resolution, multi-asset ranking, and tiered allocation.
    -   **AI Signal Verification:** GPT-4o powered verification of signals.
    -   **Signal Scheduler:** Manages staggered symbol scanning and position management.
    -   **Trade Engine (V2):** S/R + Fibonacci confluence TP/SL (swing highs/lows, fib retracement/extension, BB bands), 30% profit-based trailing stop, simplified time exits (72h profitable close, 168h hard cap). One position per symbol (no multi-stage building). See `V2_SPECIFICATION.md`.
    -   **Extraction Engine:** Manages capital cycles, targeting profit percentages for auto-extraction.
    -   **Symbol Diagnostics:** `/api/diagnostics/symbols` endpoint and Settings > Diagnostics tab show per-symbol stream health, validation status, tick counts, and errors.
-   **Database Schema:** Key tables include `ticks`, `candles`, `spike_events`, `features`, `model_runs`, `backtest_trades`, `backtest_runs`, `trades`, `signal_log`, and `platform_state`.

**Deployment:**
-   Recommended deployment via Railway, using `railway.toml` and a multi-stage `Dockerfile`.
-   Legacy Docker Compose deployments are supported for Docker and Synology NAS environments.

**Instrument Catalog (29 total, 12 v1-deployed):**
- v1 Deployable (12): BOOM1000, CRASH1000, BOOM900, CRASH900, BOOM600, CRASH600, BOOM500, CRASH500, BOOM300, CRASH300, R_75, R_100
- Future catalog: R_10, R_25, R_50, RDBULL, RDBEAR, JD10-JD100, stpRNG, STP2-5, RDBR100, RDBR200

**API Keys:** deriv_api_token_demo, deriv_api_token_real, openai_api_key (legacy single deriv_api_token removed)

**Two-Layer Architecture:**
1. **Market Intelligence Layer** (always-on with stream): Scanner runs whenever streaming is active, producing signal decisions regardless of execution mode state. When no modes are active, decisions are logged with `executionStatus: "blocked"` and `rejectionReason: "No execution mode active — intelligence only"`.
2. **Execution Layer** (only with active modes): Trades are only placed when Paper, Demo, or Real mode is explicitly enabled.

**Symbol Mapping:** Some Deriv symbols use different API names (e.g., BOOM300 → BOOM300N). The `apiToConfiguredMap` on `DerivClient` handles bidirectional mapping. Collision detection prevents two configured symbols from mapping to the same API symbol.

**Auto-streaming:** Server auto-starts tick streaming on boot unless user explicitly stopped it. Paper mode is NOT auto-enabled on boot.

**System Modes:** `idle` (no stream), `scanning` (stream on, no execution modes), `paper`/`demo`/`live` (execution modes active).

**Startup Order (Railway/production):** DB init → Listen on PORT → Start scheduler → AI auto-config → Symbol validation → 12-month candle backfill (paginated, partial success ≥8/12) → Tick streaming → Health at /api/healthz

**Data Backfill:** On startup, auto-backfills 12 months of 1m and 5m candle history for all 12 symbols via paginated Deriv API calls (5,000 candles per page). Uses `onConflictDoNothing` so re-runs fill gaps without duplicating. Partial success model: proceeds if ≥8/12 symbols succeed; failed symbols shown with "Re-download from Research > Data Status". Data older than 12 months is automatically pruned.

**Research Page:** Overhauled with Data Status section (per-symbol health cards), Download & Simulate (SSE per-symbol), Re-run Backtest, grouped backtest results by symbol (only profitable strategies), and AI Chat per backtest. Routes in `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/research.ts`. Backtests now run 1 pass per symbol with all 4 strategies, storing strategyBreakdown in metricsJson (12 backtests instead of 48).

## External Dependencies

-   **Deriv:** For synthetic indices trading, market data, and account management via WebSocket API.
-   **PostgreSQL:** Primary database for persistent storage.
-   **OpenAI GPT-4o:** Used for AI-powered backtest analysis, signal verification, and the AI chatbot advisor.

## AI Chatbot System
The AI chatbot (`/api/ai/chat`) is a comprehensive trading advisor with:
- **Full system knowledge**: 12-section knowledge base covering all platform concepts, strategy families, signal pipeline, position sizing formulas, trade lifecycle, capital extraction, settings glossary, regime definitions, and technical glossary
- **Dynamic context injection**: Each conversation includes live system state (active modes, capital, recent performance, pending AI suggestions)
- **Trade analysis tool** (`analyze_trades`): Queries recent trades with 7 focus modes (overview, by_strategy, by_symbol, durations, tp_sl_effectiveness, recent_closed, open_positions)
- **Signal analysis tool** (`analyze_signals`): Queries signal logs with 5 focus modes (hit_rates, rejection_reasons, regime_distribution, score_distribution, by_symbol)
- **Suggestion writing** (`write_suggestions`): Writes ai_suggest_ keys only — never changes actual settings
- **Changelog section**: Tracks recent system changes so the AI stays current
